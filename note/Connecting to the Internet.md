When the first internet began, the user had access through a "Dial Up" connection, along the copper wire using a modem.
Transmission speeds were very slow (only 300 bit per second).
Nowadays more and more people have broadband connections which can handle much greater volumes of data at much greater speed.
There are different ways of gaining broadband access to the internet.


# ADSL

(Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line). This technology can deliver up to 40 megabits per second, using the copper telephone.
It requires a ADSL modem which plugs into the phone socket and then connects to the computer.
To eliminate noise or interference, you can connects a microfilter.



# Cable
---
Some cables tv companies offer a cable connections using their existing wiring, which may be a copper or fibre-optic.
Internet access via cable can reach speeds of up to 500 megabits per second, the capacity may drop if a lot of people are using it at the same time.



# Satellite
---
Through a satellite dish pointed we can access to communications satellite in orbit using a special DVB modem, In remote area this is the only practical way to obtain internet connection.
The connections can be interrupted by weather conditions.



# Mobile Networks
---
This method provide an internet connections without any fixed telephone line.
Access is offered by mobile phone using the same signals as for cellphones, using a built-in reception for mobile phone networks. 
It is also possible to plug in a small USB modem, called 'Dongle'.
We have a different drawbacks, such as usage limits, varying speeds and unstable connections.
